=======Responsibilities taken by each team member for building the system========

Harshit Dixit-Backend development(java and spring boot)
(further i will also handle the frontend development too)

=======Steps to execute the solution===========

1-)Firstl I implemented Different Model Classes according to the given problem

2-)After that i implemented services for our application so that we can fulfill the user demand according.
For Example-
Auditorium Service- To chech Movie Auditoriums in the city where a user want to see movie.
Booking Service-To check Booking of the user .
MovieService-To check which type of movies are there in Movie Cinemas and also which movie user wanted to see.
Seat service-As the Problem Statemnet said their will be 5 person limit to book seats acc to that i had implemented the Seat Service And Seat Booking Service
And lastly
User Service-To check the activities of user this user service is implemented.

3-)After that there are some apli Calls to fetch the data(eg- seat booking data,Screening data, Auditorium data etc) in json format
I was unable to implement UI due to lack of time.
But if u approve my application i promise u I will complete this Project very soon.
Instead od that im still working on it so that if u select my application then i could show you my complete project.

Due to lack of time and also due to lazyness of my team members only i worked on it.
